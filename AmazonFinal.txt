 a. Find all anagrams of a given string.
The question is simple but there was a twist,the file size was 1TB.Interviewer asked me to optimize the solution.I gave a HashMap solution where key was the length of strings in the file and value was number of such strings.
Finally,I was able to solve the question with Trie data structure.
b. Given a Hotel and checkin/Checkout time of visitors, find the maximum numbers of rooms required. (different version of Trains/Platform question)
c. Given two strings print all possible permutations of two strings such that the order of characters are maintained.
I gave a topological sort solution and then a recursive solution.
.Given an array,generate all valid ip address from the array.

Q1 : Given a M*N matrix . you have to start from Index(0,0) and reach to Index(M-1,N-1) with maximum sum , given the constraint that you can only move right or down i.e if you are at index (i,j), you can only move to index(i,j+1) or to index(i+1,j)

Given sequentially placed boxes, each representing a number( which may be positive or negative), we need to select the numbers in order to have the maximum sum, 
	having the constraint that if we seelct a given box, we cannot select adjacent box to it, but can select any other.
Given 2 numbers, add them without using any arithmetic operator.
   
   1. Given a file having many lines of text(words) and given a dictionary having an API function boolean isValid(String word), which will return true is a word passed to this function is valid word in dic.,and will return false if given passed argument is not a valid word in dic.

Now read the file and check if each word as well as all possible words from its L to R and R to L combinations, are valid words in dic. or not.

Given a 1D array where each cell represents a toll gate ticket value. Find the minimum number of tickets needed to surpass the whole array (means till u reach the end of array) .
If ticket value is 1 then u can pass that cell alone. If ticket value is 2 u can pass that cell and the next cell.. that is how ticket values work.
